Axioms
- source is always a regular file
- target may be present or not
- target could be a regular file
- target could be a symlink

Ensure
- backup the target if present
- place the source at the target site


case 0
======

no target present

expected results
- create symlink to source at target

case 1
======

target and src are different files
target is a regular file

expected results
- backup of target is created
- create symlink to source at target


case 2
======

target is a symlink to another file(real target)

expected result
- create a new symlink to the real target, this is the back up of the existing target
- create symlink to source at target



case 3

======

target is a symlink to source
